**Spam Email Detection using TensorFlow**

Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect whether an email is spam or not spam (ham). It uses TensorFlow for model building and training, and NLP techniques for text preprocessing. The goal is to demonstrate text classification skills and practical knowledge of deep learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP).



**Features**

Data cleaning and preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)

Wordcloud visualization

Model building using TensorFlow

Evaluation with metrics such as Accuracy

Visualization of training performance (loss and accuracy curves)



**Technologies Used**

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn


**Dataset**

The dataset used contains labeled emails categorized as spam or ham.
